# metrics_eval

[metrics_eval](https://github.com/AmenRa/metrics_eval) is a collection of fast metrics implemented in Python, taking advantage of [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) for high speed vector operations and automatic parallelization.

The goal of the project is to create a package of high performant metrics implementations that can be used in Python for research.

It currently contains only metrics used for the evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems (Search Engines) and Recommender Systems.

## Available Metrics
### Ranking Metrics:
* Hit List
* Hits
* Precision
* Recall
* rPrecision
* Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
* Average Precision (AP)
* Mean Average Precision (MAP)
* Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)
* Ideal Discounted Cumulative Gain (IDCG)
* Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)

Ranking metrics have been tested against [TREC Eval](https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval) for correctness — through a comparison with [pytrec_eval](https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval).

The implemented metrics are up to 50 times faster than [pytrec_eval](https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval) and with a much lower memory footprint (_see [pytrec_eval_comparison](https://github.com/AmenRa/metrics_eval/tree/master/pytrec_eval_comparison) folder_).

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.7
* Numba >= 0.49.1
* Numpy >= 1.15

## Installation
WORK IN PROGRESS

## Usage
```python
from metrics_eval import ndcg
import numpy as np

# Note that y_true does not need to be ordered
# Integers are documents IDs, while floats are the true relevance scores
y_true = np.array([[[12, 0.5], [25, 0.3]], [[11, 0.4], [2, 0.6]]])
y_pred = np.array([[12, 234, 25, 36, 32, 35], [12, 11, 25, 36, 2, 35]])
k = 5

ndcg(y_true, y_pred, k)
>>> 0.7525653965843032
```

metrics_eval support the usage of y_true elements of different lenght by using a list of arrays:
```python
from metrics_eval import ndcg
import numpy as np

y_true = [np.array([[12, 0.5], [25, 0.3]]), np.array([[11, 0.4], [2, 0.6], [12, 0.1]])]
y_pred = np.array([[12, 234, 25, 36, 32, 35], [12, 11, 25, 36, 2, 35]])
k = 5

ndcg(y_true, y_pred, k)
>>> 0.7525653965843032
```

However, for maximum speed, consider converting the y_true list to a [Numba Typed List](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/pysupported.html#typed-list) by simply using the provided utility function:
```python
from metrics_eval import ndcg, utils
import numpy as np

y_true = [np.array([[12, 0.5], [25, 0.3]]), np.array([[11, 0.4], [2, 0.6], [12, 0.1]])]
y_pred = np.array([[12, 234, 25, 36, 32, 35], [12, 11, 25, 36, 2, 35]])
k=5

y_true = utils.to_typed_list(y_true)

ndcg(y_true, y_pred, k)
>>> 0.786890544287473
```
