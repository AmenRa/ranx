## Hits
---
**Hits** is the number of relevant documents retrieved.

## Hit Rate / Success
---
**Hit Rate** is the fraction of queries for which at least one relevant document is retrieved.
Note: it is equivalent to `success` from [trec_eval](https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval).

## Precision
---
**Precision** is the proportion of the retrieved documents that are relevant.

$$
\operatorname{Precision}=\frac{r}{n}
$$

where,

- $r$ is the number of retrieved relevant documents;
- $n$ is the number of retrieved documents.

## Recall
---
**Recall** is the ratio between the retrieved documents that are relevant and the total number of relevant documents.

$$
\operatorname{Recall}=\frac{r}{R}
$$

where,

- $r$ is the number of retrieved relevant documents;
- $R$ is the total number of relevant documents.

## F1
---
**F1** is the harmonic mean of [**Precision**][precision] and [**Recall**][recall].

$$
\operatorname{F1} = 2 \times \frac{\operatorname{Precision} \times \operatorname{Recall}}{\operatorname{Precision} + \operatorname{Recall}}
$$

## R-Precision
---
For a given query $Q$, **R-Precision** is the precision at $R$, where $R$ is the number of relevant documents for $Q$. In other words, if there are $r$ relevant documents among the top-$R$ retrieved documents, then R-precision is:

$$
\operatorname{R-Precision} = \frac{r}{R}
$$

## Bpref
---
**Bpref** is designed for situations where relevance judgments are known to be incomplete. It is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{bpref}=\frac{1}{R}\sum_r{1 - \frac{|\text{$n$ ranked higher than $r$}|}{R}}
$$

where,

- $r$ is a relevant document;
- $n$ is a member of the first R judged nonrelevant documents as retrieved by the system;
- $R$ is the number of relevant documents.

## Rank-biased Precision
Compute Rank-biased Precision (RBP).

It is defined as:

$$
\operatorname{RBP} = (1 - p) \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{d}{r_i \cdot p^{i - 1}}
$$

where,

- $p$ is the persistence value;
- $r_i$ is either 0 or 1, whether the $i$-th ranked document is non-relevant or relevant, respectively.

## (Mean) Reciprocal Rank
---
**Reciprocal Rank** is the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first retrieved relevant document: 1 for first place, 1/2 for second place, 1/3 for third place, and so on. When averaged over many queries, it is usually called **Mean Reciprocal Rank** (MRR).

$$
Reciprocal Rank = \frac{1}{rank}
$$

where,

- $rank$ is the position of the first retrieved relevant document.

## (Mean) Average Precision
---
**Average Precision** is the average of the Precision scores computed after each relevant document is retrieved. When averaged over many queries, it is usually called **Mean Average Precision** (MAP).

$$
\operatorname{Average Precision} = \frac{\sum_r \operatorname{Precision}@r}{R}
$$

where,

- $r$ is the position of a relevant document;
- $R$ is the total number of relevant documents.

## DCG
